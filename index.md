features:
  - title: Have all the info you need without leaving the text you're studying. 
    details: You will be able to listen to the pronunciation of each word, as well as get its translation in real time, all without leaving the app (and thus without stopping to read the text). You won't have to worry about looking up the meaning of words you don't know on dictionaries, going on google translate to listen to the pronunciation and manually making the flashcards; LinGo does all of this for you. 
  - title: Insta-translation support for over 150 languages
    details: There is also tts support for over 30 languages; not only this but you will also be able to import your own custom languages in the app super-fast; just keep in mind that for these custom languages tts and translations might not work.
  - title: Export your words in anki/memrise flashcards.
    details: When you will study texts with LinGo, you will be able to automatically make flashcards out of them and export them in most major flashcard systems.
  - title: Support for scriptio-continua languages.
    details: LinGo supports also languages which do not have spaces in between words, and is able to tokenize (i.e recognize the different words in a text) texts in those languages via some nlp models. In particular, with LinGo you will be able to study japanese,thai,khmer and chinese (also integrated with tts and insta-translation).
