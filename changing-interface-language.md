# Changing the language of your application

I acknowledge that a lot of people might've downloaded this application to study english, or maybe they want to study another language but they're not fluent enough in english to be able to use it as the "base" language for their studies. For this reason, I implemented other 6 languages with which you can use LinGo. These are:

* French
* Russian
* Italian
* German
* Spanish
* English

To change the language of your interface, just go inside the "setup" folder, and open the "bootLanguage.txt" file: once you're there, just replace the content of said file with the language code of the language you want to use as the main language. The language codes are the following:

* French --> fr
* Russian --> ru
* Italian --> it
* German --> de
* Spanish --> es
* English --> en
